## Provides guidance on starting the API development environments for IA Node Access application.

Once Access is cloned, it is easy get started with Access API. Simply install Yarn:

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

#### Prerequisite
- MongoDB

There are two ways to develop within the IA Node Access project, depending on your use case - with token validation and without. The only prerequisite is a MongoDB instance running (if you don't have one, you can use the docker-compose in the root of the project).

#### Without Token Validation - Full development mode
This is the mode for most developers. In basic development mode, making use of the dev_env.sh script:

```
source dev_env.sh
```

This sets the OPENID_PROVIDER_URL to "development". This setup has a user (test+dev@ndtp.co.uk) built in who has authorization for all of the API. Any requests made in development mode will be performed in Access by this built-in test user, including other services calling the /whoami endpoint.

If you want to pass your own token on API in this mode, you can do. Using the JWT_HEADER, put a token in and the API will accept it and use it without validation. This is useful when looking to test out authorization with the API.

#### With Token Validate
This mode allows a developer to spin up an IdP to validate tokens against. Within cognito-local, there is a readme on how to spin up a setup with 4 users and instructions on how to create tokens for each. These can then be passed using the JWT_HEADER; we have provided a token_env.sh script for convenience of running the API with the correct env variables.

#### Start cognito-local
Instructions for starting cognito-local can be found in the readme within the directory.

#### Start Mongo and the API
[OPTIONAL] - If you have a mongo service running on your box you can also use this

- Navigate to the root of the project.
- `docker compose up`

> Note: if you are developing the API you will not need to start both services
> in the compose file.
> To start just the Mongo service: `docker compose up mongo`

#### Start the API Development Environment
- Navigate to the root of the project.
- `yarn` _(optional)_ Install or update packages if not already done.
- `yarn dev`

## Environment Variables
Access can be configured using the below environment variables

## Developer Notes

### Making a commit
Git commit messages should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Mongo Scripts
Running `docker compose up` or `docker compose up mongo` in the root will run
Mongo with the appropriate users pre-configured. However, if you prefer or need
to configure Mongo users manually, the links below will assist you with this:

1. [Create a root user](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/configure-scram-client-authentication/#std-label-create-user-admin)
   using the root credentials listed in
   [development-credentials](#development-credentials).
2. [Create a user](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/create-users/)
   using the non-root credentials and initialise the database listed in
   [development-credentials](#development-credentials).
